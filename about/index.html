			<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>My very first interest on computers dates from my teenage years, when the hard drive from my first PC died. I was 12 years old, and while trying to get some fix to my computer, I felt myself ashmed because someone told me that <em>&ldquo;the issue is the hard drive and the fix will cost you this!&rdquo;</em> and I could not do anything about it &hellip; because I did not know what a Hard Drive were or meant &hellip;</p>

<p>Since that day, several situations related to computers intrigued me a lot, aways caming to me like a karma &hellip; From the obscure DOS commands to several floppy disks needed to install a new game; from the unreliable dial-up internet connection of the end of 90s to computer viruses and Win98 re-installations &hellip; I knew <em>inside</em> that I needed to learn more about all of that.</p>

<p>When I was 15, I started a two-years technical course on Electronics / Electrictian, and I get a chance to learn the very basic foundations on how computers are made : I learned about boolean algebra, transistors, digital circuits, something about microprocessors, and I even &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; for the very first time using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller">PLCs</a>. However, I still did not understand how my PC at home <strong>really</strong> works &hellip; And I knew that I still had more to learn.</p>

<p>At 18 I started my very first bachelor course at <a href="http://www.unicamp.br/">UNICAMP</a> on Mathematics. I gave up in first period, because I felt that Computer Science should be my way, and I was not able to qualify to CS at the admission tests (called &ldquo;Vestibular&rdquo; in Brazil) &hellip; I love Math until today, and after trying again and again, I had <strong>TONS</strong> of math courses at <a href="https://usp.br/">USP</a>, the university where I gratuated on Computer Science (several years later) and the instituition I own all my formal background, and much more.</p>

<p>While studying Computer Science - in a fulltime course - ironically, I did not see myself as a fulltime programmer, anyday; I quite <em>disliked</em> programming at my first CS days, and I had much more interest on computer infrastructure knowledge and courses, like Networks, Operational Systems, Computer Architecture and so on &hellip; My first internship  - dealing with front-end development of our library website - using technologies like JQuery and Javascript circa 2008 did not help either in this context.</p>

<p>But, in 2009 the world was totally hyped about smartphones, and bought my first Macbook as well. I started to learn about iPhone programming - trying to grasp objective-C with my naive C background - and when the first iPad was launched, I realized that Mobile could become &ldquo;the next Ruby on Rails&rdquo; to focus and learn. I remember that several friends from that days picked up the technical carrer as a developer with Web development, while I started to learn Android as well, once we had a strong Java background from CS courses (I and could not afford an iPhone at that time)</p>

<p>I have been doing software development for Mobile platforms professionaly since 2010. I work both with Android and iOS, but since 2013, I decided to become an Android specialist; I deep dived on this ecossystem, and offered this knowledge for several successful products on the perspective of Brazillian market, like <a href="https://www.vivareal.com.br/">VivaReal</a>, <a href="https://www.magazineluiza.com.br/">Magazine Luiza</a> and <a href="https://openbank.stone.com.br/">Stone Pagamentos</a>.</p>

<p>I worked for several industries across dozen of projects, from content media apps to e-commerce, and I faced several different challenging problems across all of them, learning a lot. I have been working with backend development, and nowadays I&rsquo;m 100% interested in the backend landscape since we have Kotlin as new shining option on this field, and we have technologies like Serverless as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a father of a beautiful boy, who lives in Brazil with her mother. At the spare time, I like to learn a little bit more about philoshopy, sociology and other human sciences. As a computer nerd, I enjoy the most of the usual geek stuff as well, but I&rsquo;m not into games for no special reason &hellip;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I see myself just like a curious guy, and a hardworker person instead of a super-clever one.</p>
