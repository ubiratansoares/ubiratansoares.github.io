			<p>My very first interest on computers dates from my teenage years, when the hard drive from my first PC died. I was 12 years old, and while trying to get some fix to my computer, I felt myself ashmed because someone told me that <em>&ldquo;the issue is the hard drive and the fix will cost you this amount&rdquo;</em> and I could not do anything about it &hellip; because I did not know what a &ldquo;Hard Drive&rdquo; were or meant &hellip;</p>

<p>Since that day, several situations related to computers intrigued me a lot, aways hitting me in a karmatic way &hellip; From the obscure DOS commands to several floppy disks needed to install a new game; from the unreliable dial-up internet connection of the end of 90s to computer viruses and Win98 re-installations &hellip; I knew <em>inside</em> that I needed to learn more about all of that.</p>

<p>When I was 15, I started a two-years technical, hybrid Electronics / Electrictian course, and I get a chance to learn the very basic foundations on how computers are made : I learned about boolean algebra, transistors, digital circuits, something about microprocessors, and I even &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; for the very first time using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller">PLCs</a>. However, I still can&rsquo;t figure out how my PC at home <strong>really</strong> works &hellip; And I knew that I still had more to learn.</p>

<p>At 18 I started my very first bachelor course at <a href="http://www.unicamp.br/">UNICAMP</a> on Mathematics. I gave up in first year, because I felt that Computer Science should be my way &hellip;</p>

<p><em>and I was not able to qualify to CS at the admission tests (called &ldquo;Vestibular&rdquo; in Brazil)</em></p>

<p>I love Math until today, and after trying again and again, I finally owned the admission tests and I had <strong>TONS</strong> of math courses at <a href="https://usp.br/">USP</a>, the university where I gratuated on Computer Science (several years later) and the instituition I own all my formal background, and much more.</p>

<p>While studying Computer Science, ironically I did not see myself as a fulltime programmer in the very beggining; I quite <em>disliked</em> programming at my first CS days, and I had much more interest on &ldquo;computer building blocks&rdquo; knowledge and courses, like Networks, Operational Systems, Computer Architecture, Databases and so on &hellip; My first internship  - dealing with front-end development of our library website - using technologies like JQuery and Javascript circa 2008 did not help in this context, either.</p>

<p>But, in 2009 the world was totally hyped about smartphones, and just had bought my first Macbook. I started to learn about iPhone programming - trying to grasp the Objective-C weirdness with my naive C background - and when the first iPad was launched, I realized that Mobile could become <em>&ldquo;the next Ruby on Rails&rdquo;</em> to focus and learn. I remember that several friends from that days picked up the technical carrer as a developer with web development, while I started to learn Android as well, once I got a strong Java background from my CS practical assigments and was familiar with Eclipse IDE.</p>

<p><em>(and because I could not afford an iPhone <strong>and</strong> a Macbook at that time)</em></p>

<p>I learned how to enjoy programming everyday, and I have been doing software development for Mobile platforms <strong>professionally</strong> since 2010. I worked both with Android and iOS in the early days, but since 2013, I decided to become an Android specialist; I deep dived on this eco-system, and offered this knowledge for several successfull products delivery in Brazil, like <a href="https://www.vivareal.com.br/">VivaReal</a>, <a href="https://www.magazineluiza.com.br/">Magazine Luiza</a> and <a href="https://openbank.stone.com.br/">Stone Pagamentos</a>.</p>

<p>I worked for several industries over the years, from content media to e-commerce apps, across dozens of projects, and I faced several different and challenging problems across all of them, always learning a lot. I have been playing with backend development, and nowadays I&rsquo;m quite excited with the backend (again!) since we have Kotlin as new shining option on this field, and we have technologies like Serverless with growing quite fast.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a father of a beautiful boy, who lives in Brazil with her mother. At the spare time, I like to learn a little bit more about philosophy, sociology and other human sciences. As a computers nerd, I enjoy the most of the usual geek stuff as well, but I&rsquo;m not into games for no special reason &hellip;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I see myself just like a curious guy, and a hardworker person instead of a super-clever one. I try to get better overtime on everything I do, and only I know that I can improve a lot on so many things &hellip; But, in order to keep my own sanity, nowadays I&rsquo;m just practicing this idea that a friend of mine once shared with me :</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Refactoring myself, a little bit, every day&rdquo;</em></p>
